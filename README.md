# Big Data Movie Lens Analysis using MongoDB

This project explores movie data using MongoDB and Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and PyMongo. Beginning with importing data from a CSV file and connecting to a MongoDB database, the analysis progresses through preprocessing with MongoDB's aggregation framework. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib, showcasing insights such as top movies by revenue and public vote, language combinations generating high revenue, and production companies with multiple million-dollar successes. Trend analysis examines genre, production company, and country trends over time, while text analysis identifies common themes in movie overviews, aided by MongoDB indexing for efficient text searches. Overall, the project offers comprehensive insights into the movie industry, leveraging MongoDB's aggregation capabilities and Python's visualization tools to deliver meaningful analysis.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and derive insights from a dataset containing information about movies. The main steps involved in the process are as follows:

### Data Import

Movie data is imported from a CSV file into a MongoDB database.

### Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing operations are performed using MongoDB's aggregation framework. Data is cleaned and transformed as necessary.

### Visualization

Matplotlib is used to create visualizations for various insights derived from the data. Visualizations include plots of top movies by revenue and public vote, language combinations generating high revenue, and production companies with multiple million-dollar successes.

### Trend Analysis

Trends over time are analyzed for genres, production companies, and countries. Insights into the evolution of movie preferences are extracted.

### Text Analysis

Text analysis is conducted on movie overviews to identify common themes or topics. Natural language processing techniques are employed for this analysis.

### Indexing

MongoDB indexing is implemented to improve the efficiency of text searches during analysis. Query performance for text-based analysis is enhanced.
